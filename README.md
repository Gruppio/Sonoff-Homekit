### Homekit runs on the Sonoff ! ðŸ˜³

Unlike other projects on github, this firmware does NOT require anything else in order to work.
It is not based on the Tasmota Fw, you don't need HomeBridge running on a Raspberry-Pi or an MQTT server, since HomeKit runs natively are enough a Wi-Fi connection and an Apple Device!

The implementation use Apple provided specifications for developers, so it is a stable and supported software and it will keep working for a long time.

Now you finally can have a HomeKit devices without spending a lot of money!

### Compatible Devices
This Software is currently tested on: **Sonoff Basic**, **Sonoff Slampher**, **Sonoff S26** (thanks Arjan)

## New Functionalities

### Web Page Controller
For control your Sonoff from a non Apple device just navigate to the Sonoff IP address and a web page will allow you to turn it on or off

### Rest APIs
A full set of Rest APIs are available:
* **/on**
* **/off**
* **/toggle**
* **/state**

All the request are in **GET** and are relative to the IP address of the Sonoff.
In order to turn on the Sonoff at IP 192.168.0.22 you can: `$ curl 192.168.0.22/on`

### AutoReconnect after power outage
A problem with the old firmware was that after a power outage the Sonoff was immediately searching for the stored WIFI connection, but since the router was still powering on the Sonoff was prompting the configuration procedure. Now this problem is fixed, if the Sonoff does not have a WIFI Connection every 10min the Sonoff will restart.

### Selectable PowerOn state
By default the Sonoff will have a Enabled state at power on, you can change this by selecting "OFF" in the `flash.sh` script
